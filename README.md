Great! Based on your work on training an English-to-Ga neural translation model from scratch (using a Seq2Seq LSTM model, with wandb logging and tokenizer saving), here’s a clean and descriptive `README.md` you can include in your project:

---

## 🧠 English-to-Ga Neural Machine Translation

This project trains a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) LSTM-based neural translation model to translate from English to Ga, a Ghanaian language. It is built entirely from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras.

### 🚀 Project Features

* **Custom Seq2Seq model** with LSTM encoder-decoder architecture.
* **Tokenizers built from scratch** using training data.
* **No vocab size limitation**, allowing the full dataset vocabulary.
* **WandB integration** for experiment tracking and visualization.
* **Early stopping and model checkpointing** to avoid overfitting and ensure recovery.
* **Google Colab + Google Drive** used for training and saving models.

### 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow 2.x
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* wandb

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn wandb
```

---

### 📊 Training Configuration

```python
embedding_dim = 256
lstm_units = 512
batch_size = 64
epochs = 20
validation_split = 0.2
learning_rate = 0.001
```

Tracked via [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/) under the project name: `english-ga-translation`.

### 📦 Data Format

Your dataset is a tab-separated values file (`data.tsv`) with two columns:

```
English_sentence \t Ga_translation
```

Before training:

* All text is lowercased and stripped.
* Ga sentences are wrapped with `startseq` and `endseq` tokens.

---

### 🧪 Inference Example

To use the trained model for inference:

```python
def translate_sentence(input_text):
    # preprocess + encode input_text
    # use encoder_model + decoder_model
    return ga_translation
```

---

### 📝 Future Work

* Improve tokenization with SentencePiece or BPE.
* Add attention mechanism to handle long sentences.
* Fine-tune using larger or external datasets.
* Evaluate using BLEU or other metrics.
